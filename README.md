# PizzaRollsDiscordBot
An open source matchmaking DiscordBot.

Using Zipf's law, I believe I will be able to make lasting relationships by matching people with similar Zipf curves.

This code requires Discord.js and Dotenv, use 'npm install' to resolve them.

To use this code, make a file named ".env", add a line "BOT_TOKEN='YOUR_KEY_HERE'", and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your bot's key.
