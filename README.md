# PizzaRollsDiscordBot
An open source matchmaking DiscordBot.

I believe I can match people who speak similarly.

This code requires Discord.js, JSONStream and Dotenv, use 'npm install' to resolve them.

To use this code, make a file named ".env", add a line "BOT_TOKEN='YOUR_KEY_HERE'", and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your bot's key.
